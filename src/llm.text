# Project Context: Ipsa's Kalinga Kitchen

## Project Overview
This is a mobile-first web application for a catering and restaurant business called "Ipsa's Kalinga Kitchen". The app currently serves as a digital menu and portfolio to showcase authentic Odia and Indian cuisine.

## Technical Stack
* **Framework:** Angular 17+ (Standalone Components, Signals, New Control Flow `@if`, `@for`).
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Mobile-first utility classes).
* **Backend/Data:** Firebase Firestore (for dynamic menu data and "Today's Special").
* **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting.

## Current Functionality (Phase 1 - MVP)
* **Navigation:** Sticky top navbar with logo; mobile hamburger menu with slide-down navigation.
* **Home Page:**
    * Hero section with background image and call-to-action.
    * "Today's Special" section (dynamically fetched from Firestore).
    * Services/Specializations (Puja Food, Wedding Catering, etc.).
* **Menu Page:**
    * Sticky horizontal category bar (scrollable on mobile).
    * Categorized menu listing (Appetizers, Entrees, etc.).
    * **Complex Pricing:** Supports varied pricing models:
        * Sized portions (Small/Medium/Large).
        * Per-piece pricing (e.g., "$1.50 each").
        * "Market Price" / "DM for Pricing" items.
    * **Display Only:** No cart or checkout functionality yet. Users call to order.

## Future Roadmap (Phase 2 - Planned)
* **User Accounts:** Firebase Authentication (Google/Phone login).
* **E-Commerce:**
    * "Add to Cart" functionality.
    * Order summary/Cart page.
* **Payments:** Integration with Stripe or similar provider for online checkout.
* **Admin Dashboard:** A simple interface to update the "Today's Special" and menu prices without code changes.

## Design Constraints
* **Mobile-First:** All layouts must look perfect on mobile screens first, then scale up to desktop.
* **Brand Colors:**
    * Primary Orange: #ee8c2b
    * Deep Red: #8B0000
    * Backgrounds: Off-white (#f8f7f6) for light mode.
